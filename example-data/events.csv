Extended reality (XR) is an emerging form that offers new creative opportunities in immersive narrative meaning-making. The critical shift toward participant immersion within digital information systems and simulation makes the scale of immersive media’s potential impact on human life, culture, and well-being, unlike any previous medium. As a new medium, XR presents unique challenges to media arts creators. In this workshop, participants will explore an immersive experience (XRX) design methodology for designing, planning, and executing immersive media works. The presenters define immersive experience design as a rhetorical, multimodal composition of objective stimuli to create subjective emotional states in the participants. The method applies design-thinking-based knowledge systems to enhance narrative transportation and presence. The methodology has been implemented in project-oriented courses over three years. Templates and handouts will be provided to facilitate implementation of the methodology by teams participating in MIT Reality Hack 2023.
